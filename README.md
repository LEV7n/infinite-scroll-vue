# Yo listen up, it's a story..
I decided to do all that possible using classes (Factory/Builder) because in my mind it's only way
to do project within beautiful and correct structure, interchangeability of classes following patterns.

I don't like singleton/multiton/object pool patterns. I feeling that it slower than factory,
and have too unelegan look instead of one i used.

P.S. Yeah, i'm maniac of JSDOC =)
If you feel i did something wrong, please tell me - I like learning new approaches and improving myself.
